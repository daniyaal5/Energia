# Energia

The path variable in Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb should be changed to the path of the folder containing the excel files. All these excell files are then merged into one large file containing data for the entire month of March.

The merged data is then used to handle missing values and lastly, the imputed data is saved as EnergiaData.csv file. 
This is the final file that is used in the clustering models.
